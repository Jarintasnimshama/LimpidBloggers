MVC
M-> Models
V-> Views
C-> Controllers

Models: It will contain all database related codes. Like: funtion of getting
data from a perticular table or updating or deleting etc.
In our case Model folder contains 11 files.
10 files are the entity(tables) of the database. 1 file(DBC.php) for database connection, get and
execute function. 

Views: It will contain web pages.
In our case we have 4 additional folder inside view folder
Folder Admin--> Only Admin Accessible pages.
Moderator --> Only Moderator Accessible pages.
Bloggers --> Some commonly accesssible pages and some bloggers accessible pages.
Common --> All commonly accessible page. (Login, Registration, Blogs etc)

Controllers: Every page have its own controller. 
1. Manage button actions of pages.
2. Delivering data from database to views
3. Form validation (server side)
4. Session and cookie validation

Thats all about mvc.
In short controllers get data form models and pass to views and additionally manages actions
and validations of a page.
